This project is designed to offer donations to local Chicago family owned businesses that were recently effected by looting.
The motivation behind this project is to not only allow communtiy members to offer cash via GOFUNDME but also be able to reach out to the business owners and offer their services or expertise.
The project is hosted via heroku and can be accessed at: https://calm-dawn-77458.herokuapp.com/
